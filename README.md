This library provides a Windows PowerShell interface to the HPE SimpliVity REST APIs.

HPE SimpliVity cmdlets perform REST API operations to the HPE SimpliVity system.
These cmdlets can be used to get and set HPE SimpliVity data and invoke actions on the HPE Simplivity system.

This PowerShell project is developed for those that want to automate tasks within HPE SimpliVity or use PowerShell as a CLI for HPE SimpliVity operations. To get support with the library, please use the project Issue Tracker.
